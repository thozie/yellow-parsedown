# yellow-parsedown
Yellow Parsedown is a plugin for [Yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow) which exchanges the standard Yellow Markdown Parser from  [http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/] with the faster Parsedown Parser from [https://github.com/erusev/parsedown]. At present it is in experimental state.
